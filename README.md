The evapoRate R package is a set of functions that aid in the tracking of solution chemistry changes as a result of evaporation, including the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> gas exchange and CaCO<sub>3</sub> mineral precipitation.

A walkthrough with examples is provided in the "examples" folder.

Although the functionality of evapoRate is currently limited in terms of mineral precipitation, we hope to expand this in the near future.
